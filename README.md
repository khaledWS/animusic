<a href="http://dode.host">link: </a>
this project Long term goal is to be a community driven platform that is all about Anime soundtrack and music for different Anime where  the community helps in populating and verifying the data, However right now as a start it's going to be about a specific Anime and that is Attack on Titan and once the site has been polished and all necessary features have been implemented and once a community have been built we can start expanding to other Anime, the community is also Going to help with suggesting Features and give ideas. 

Right now the most simple Features are implemented :
- Being able to view the different Titles(seasons in an anime) as well as the different albums with information about them
- Viewing the tracks in an album with their length
- Viewing the music played in episodes of the anime
